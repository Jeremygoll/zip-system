### Downloading from S3 using Python

This file serves as a way to recursively download folders from AWS S3. It utilizes the `sh` library.

You will need to configure your AWS credentials locally before using this. I recommend looking up the Quickstart on how to do this via terminal.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python3 download_s3.py
```
